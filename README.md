 Programming portfolio with code examples and demos.

Thank you for taking the time to look through this programming portfolio! This contains some examples of code that I've written. 
It's a loose collection of projects and code sections to give you an idea of the kind of code that I write.

I'll be adding to this with personal projects when I can. Feel free to peruse what's here!

Best Regards,
Mark Burghard
